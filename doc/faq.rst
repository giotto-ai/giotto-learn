We are trying our best to support a variety of most-used operating systems.
If you experience any trouble, it is likely that others already have and reported it.
Please consult the list of `issues <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`_,
including the closed ones, and open a new one in case you did not find help.

There are many TDA-libraries available. How is `giotto-tda` different?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Giotto-tda is oriented towards machine learning (for details, see the :ref:`guiding principles <guiding_principles>`).
This philosophy is in contrast with other reference librairies, like `GUDHI <https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/index.html>`_,
which provide more functionality, at the expense of being less adapted to, f.ex. batch processing, or having no unified API.
