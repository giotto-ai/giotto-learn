Release 0.1.0
=============

Major Features and Improvements
-------------------------------

The following submodules where added:

-  :mod:`giotto.homology` implements transformers to modify metric spaces or generate persistence diagrams.
-  :mod:`giotto.diagrams` implements transformers to preprocess persistence diagrams or extract features from them.
-  :mod:`giotto.time_series` implements transformers to preprocess time series or embed them in a higher dimensional space for persistent homology.
-  :mod:`giotto.graphs` implements transformers to create graphs or extract metric spaces from graphs.
-  :mod:`giotto.meta_transformers` implements convenience :class:`giotto.Pipeline` transformers for direct topological feature generation.
-  :mod:`giotto.utils` implements hyperparameters and input validation functions.
-  :mod:`giotto.base` implements a TransformerResamplerMixin for transformers that have a resample method.
-  :mod:`giotto.pipeline` extends scikit-learn's module by defining Pipelines that include TransformerResamplers.
